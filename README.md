Bitcoin Network Listener
===

This repository is a part of a Bitcoin Big Data project aiming to build distributed microservice 
architecture suitable to process data generated by bitcoin network in real time.

Bitcoin Network Listener is a multi-threaded high-performance endpoint connected to bitcoin
peer-to-peer network, consisting of bitcoin full nodes. It utilizes bitcoin protocol to obtain
information from the netwrok in real time on existing network participants, new blocks and
transactions (including mempool data). These data are transferred to Aerospike database for
further cloud processing.
